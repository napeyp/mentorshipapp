										<article>Volunteering to serve as a mentor in the Nape YP program is an
											excellent opportunity for Earth and space science professionals of all
											career stages to give back to the community and play a vital role in
											nurturing the next generation of scientists.</article>
										<h4>ELIGIBILITY</h4>
										<article>To participate as a mentor in the Nape YP Mentorship program, you must
											be a
											current member of one of the partner societies (AGU, AMS, AWG, IRIS, or
											SEG). Mentors can range in career stage from post docs to senior scientists.
											The most important requirements are that a mentor is dedicated to providing
											guidance and has knowledge and experience that will be useful to the mentee.
											Mentors are expected to commit roughly an hour every other week for the
											duration of the three-month program.</article>
										<h4>TIMELINE</h4>
										<article>Once matched, you will be provided a Connection Plan with adaptive
											resources for the 3-month mentorship. Mentors and mentees are encouraged to
											work through the Connection Plan to identify and work towards their
											professional goals. Program objectives are best reached with consistent and
											regular check-ins. Within a week of being matched, the mentee should contact
											their mentor to establish an initial meeting. After the first meeting the
											mentor and mentee should establish a regular schedule to meet and discuss
											progress. Mentors are asked to meet with their mentee bi-weekly for
											approximately 30 minutes. In most cases, meetings will be held virtually.
										</article>
										<h4>REQUIREMENT</h4>
										<article>
											Before being accepted into the Nape YP Mentorship program, mentors must fill
											out a
											one-page online application, which include basic questions about:
											<li> The mentor's research interests</li>
											<li> The mentor's areas of expertise to provide advice and guidance
											</li>
											<li> Prior mentoring experience
											</li>
											<li> A short paragraph describing your interest in mentoring
											</li>
											Students who are selected for the program will be able to review the above
											information to select the mentor that is best matched to with their
											professional goals. It is up to both the mentor and the mentee whether or
											not they wish to continue communicating after the 3-month mentorship has
											concluded. Mentors are also expected to fill out online evaluations
											throughout the program.
										</article>
										<h4>FREQUENTLY ASK QUESTION</h4>
										<article>

											<li>What is expected of me? Mentors are expected to provide their mentee
												with about one hour of support and interaction per month. Most of this
												interaction will take place via web-related tools (for example, Skype or
												WhatsApp). Face-to-face meetings are also encouraged, if possible.
												Mentors should work with their mentee to determine what kind of support
												will be most useful—general career advice, information on higher
												education, technical information, personal encouragement, and so on.
											</li>
											<li> How long will the commitment be? We ask our mentors to make commitments
												of at least three months to ensure that the mentee is able to fully
												benefit from the relationship. If a mentor must leave the relationship
												early, we request at least one month's notice in order to search for a
												replacement mentor with similar background.
												Are there any potential risks to me or my institution? No. It is not
												appropriate for mentors to engage in any business transactions with
												their mentees; instead, the relationship should only involve the flow of
												general information and advice.
											</li>
											<li> Relationship is not going well or I am concerned about mentorship, what
												should I do? We encourage being open with your mentee to let them know
												about the situation. Contact the program administrator immediately. We
												will provide our full support to resolve the situation in a positive and
												satisfactory manner.

										<h4>MENTOR DO'S</h4>
										<article>
											<li>COMMIT AT LEAST ONE INTERACTION/HOUR OF SUPPORT per month.</li>
											<li>Take responsibility to initiate the relationship.
											</li>
											<li>Set aside time for the mentoring process and honor all appointments.
											</li>
											<li>Invite the mentee to meetings or activities, as appropriate. Schedule
												meetings with planned topics.</li>
											<li>Be flexible on meeting times and places.</li>
											<li>Arrange frequent contacts through Skype, telephone, email, or
												face-to-face if possible.</li>
											<li>Respond to emails from your mentee within 2 days of receipt.</li>
											<li>Keep information that your mentee has shared with you confidential. If

												should first be discussed within the mentoring relationship.</li>
											<li>Establish open and honest communication and a forum for idea exchange.
											</li>
											<li>Foster creativity and independence. Help your mentee build
												self-confidence and offer encouragement.</li>
											<li>Provide honest and timely feedback to your mentee.</li>
											<li>Provide opportunities for the mentee to talk about concerns and ask

											<li>Above all, LISTEN.</li>
										</article>
										<h4>MENTOR DON'TS</h4>
										<article>
											<li>Try to give advice on everything. You don’t need to have the answers to all your mentees' questions. Your job is to answer the questions that you can and to connect your mentee to resources if you there is a question you cannot answer.</li>
											<li>Encourage mentee to be totally dependent upon you.

											</li>
											<li>Provide your personal history, problems, animosities, successes, failures, etc. unless they are constructive contributions.

											</li>
											<li>Criticize.</li>
